# 🍏 !Lifyzer Database! 🍓

Fork from [Open Food Facts](https://openfoodfacts.org) database. This database structure is different from the original "OpenFoodFacts".

It has much less columns (and removes redundant/unnecessary columns).

It adds also some helpful columns (`is_organic`, `is_healthy` columns) thanks the [Data Parser's Algorithm](https://github.com/Lifyzer/Data-Parser-System).

Finally, the **Lifyzer Database** is available under SQL format (unlike OpenFoodFacts DB) and is split into very small files (to improve readability in those files).
